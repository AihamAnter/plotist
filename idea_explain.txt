Movie Guess Game

Friends play a guessing game while watching a movie together. The website doesn’t stream the movie — it only helps them play. The movie’s name, poster, and rating come automatically from TMDb.

How it works

Create a game
One person becomes the host. They type a movie title. 
The website finds it and shows the poster and rating. 
A unique game link or code is created.

Join the game
Friends join using that link or code. 
Each one writes their name and a small password so the site knows who’s who. 
No need to register or log in.

Round one – before watching
Each player writes a guess about what the movie will be about. 
The guesses appear, but no one knows who wrote what. 
Players rate each guess from 1 to 10.
After you rate someone’s guess, their name appears only to you. 
This way, everyone rates fairly. 
When everyone’s done, the host locks the round. After locking, all names are revealed.

Watching and more rounds
Players watch the movie on their own screens.
Anyone can say “pause” and start a new round.
In each round, players make new guesses, like what might happen next.
Others rate them again. They can edit or delete their guesses until the host locks the round.
This can happen as many times as they want during the movie.

Final step – after the movie
When the movie ends, the host opens the final voting stage. 
Everyone votes if each guess was correct or wrong. 
If most players say it’s correct, it counts as correct. 
If it’s a tie, the host decides.

Scoring
For each guess, the site takes the average of all ratings it got. 
If the guess was correct, the player gains that average as points. 
If it was wrong, they lose the same amount. 
All points are added up for the final score.

Scoreboard
After voting, everyone can see the final scores. 
It shows who guessed best throughout the movie.
